# AnomTrack-SG
Smart grids require robust monitoring to detect anomalies and prevent failures. The novelty of this approach lies in its tailored DNN architecture combined with optimized feature selection, providing a scalable and precise solution for smart grid monitoring.
THE MAIN OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. To predict imminent smart grid failures using a deep neural networks.
2. To enhance feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
3. To preprocess and structure grid failure data for effective model training.
4. To design a multi-layer neural network architecture with ReLU activations.
5. To train the model using sigmoid cross-entropy loss function with L2 regularization, optimized via the Adam optimizer.
6. To evaluate model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F-score.
