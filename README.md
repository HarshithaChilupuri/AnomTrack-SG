# AnomTrack-SG
Smart grids require robust monitoring to detect anomalies and prevent failures. The novelty of this approach lies in its tailored DNN architecture combined with optimized feature selection, providing a scalable and precise solution for smart grid monitoring. Smart grid anomaly detection is of growing significance because of the complexity of contemporary power grids. A deep-learning approach to real-time fault detection and stability classification in Smart Grids is proposed. temporal and statistical features are extracted from voltage, current, and frequency signals by a dedicated DNN. Robust learning results from ReLU activation, Xavier initialization, L2 Regularization, and other Deep Learning techniques. The data, possessing high temporal resolution, records sharp changes in system dynamics, by which precise temporary anomaly identification is possible. Input data is normalized and preprocessed before input to the model for classification. The framework is also capable of early fault detection and efficient grid monitoring, which ultimately encourages wiser power systems reliability. It integrates multivariate recordings across different grid nodes and offers an exhaustive understanding of the system behaviour.
